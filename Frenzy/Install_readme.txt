How to install:
Cfg files assume retroarch overlay folder is:
/opt/retropie/emulators/retroarch/overlays/arcade-bezels/
if using a different folder-> edit cfg files accordingly
if folder does not exist on you Pi-> create arcade-bezels folder with the mentioned path

- ssh or ftp into Pi
- copy romname.zip.cfg into your mame-libretro (lr-mame2003) ROMS folder
- copy png file and romname.cfg into overlay folder

Default setting uses overlay without on screen instructions; if you'd like these edit romname.cfg:
-  uncomment, by removing #, the specific overlay line with "_1" and delete the other uncommented overlay0_overline line.

Enjoy!
